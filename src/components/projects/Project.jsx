            applications such as a food ordering app or a shopping app. I

            and Node.

            I also solve competitive programing questions on gfg and leetcode
            which help me in improving my programing skills as in competitive
            programing scenario we have to solve a problem in an optimized way.
            I also have knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithm which helps me
            in understanding how a software is working and how it was made.
          </div>
          <div>
            Along with web development i also do blockchain development which is
            creating smart contract and storing it on blockchain. In my
            blockchain journey i mave various smart contracts like minting nft,
            defi, daos etc. Blockchain is a fast growing space and it can
            takeover the web in the future.
